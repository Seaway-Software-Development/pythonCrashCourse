Intro:
||:B   | F#    | A    | E    :||

Verse 1:
G#m                       E
    I wondered when you'd turn away
    G                     F# 
The past seems to have left me stranded
G#m                  E
    Could only look ahead of me
    G                 F#
And pray that I'm not left empty handed

Pre-Chorus:
A                        E
  Would you make love to me in the rain
A                  E     F#
  Would you take away all of my pain

Chorus:
B         F#               A
   You leave me, sadly mistaken
        E
For someone I forgot to be
B            F#                   a
   And you leave me, alive and awaken
         E
From the cold life once in me

Verse 2:
G#m                       E
    A soft breeze blowing through your hair
        B                      F#
And the sent, of your beautiful body rising
G#m                       E
    Your hands acrossed my tired flesh
   B                     F#
My racing heart is by no means surprizing

Pre-Chorus:
A                         E
   Would you make love to me till I'm drained
A                 E        F#
   Would you take away all of my pain

Chorus:
B         F#                A
    You leave me, sadly mistaken
        E                
For someone I forgot to be
B            F#                    A
    And you leave me, alive and awaken
         E
From the cold life once in me

Bridge:
D#m               G#m
    Its finally a new day
     E                      F#
As I wrap myself in your sincerity
A                  E     
    So I read life backwards now
     F#
That I have found my clarity

Pre-Chorus:
A                        E
  Would you make love to me in the rain
A                  D     F#
  Would you take away all of my pain

Chorus:
B         F#               A
   You leave me, sadly mistaken
        E
For someone I forgot to be
B            F#                   A
   And you leave me, alive and awaken
         E
From the cold life once in me
B         F#              A
   You leave me...
         E
Sadly mistaken...
B         F#                 A
   You leave me, alive and awaken
         E
From the cold life once in me
